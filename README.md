## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS Preprocessor

### What I learned

A lot of the niceties of Sass/SCSS have been integrated into CSS3 -- such as variable use, min/max, calc -- but it's still nice to be able to call variables easily ($variable vs. var(--variable)) and to nest selectors. 

### Continued development

- Continue to hone CSS skills and get better at utilizing the more complex functions offered by Sass
- Improve my accessibility/semantic HTML usage

### Useful resources

- [Learn Box Alignment](https://ishadeed.com/article/learn-box-alignment/) - This is my go-to site for reminding me how Flexbox and Grid elements work.
- [Tota11y FireFox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tota11y-accessibility-toolkit/) - Assists in visualizing how the current web page will perform with assistive technologies.
